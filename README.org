* WHPC: Workshop Organization Notes

These notes are from efforts to organize the Women in HPC workshops.
We have had successful workshops at both the International Supercomputing Conference and the Supercomputing Conference since 2014.
As WHPC grows, we hope to cultivate new leaders and encourage our members to contribute to the workshop organization efforts.
